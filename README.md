## Background
The idea behind this project was to create a fun simple game that could be played by 2 people on 1 mobile device. It probably works best on something like a tablet. It wasn't the original intent, but I might add multi-device/AI support in the future. The game was created from scratch, meaning that much of the development was creating background systems that a game engine would commonly take care of. It was created as a hobby project to learn more about web and game development.
